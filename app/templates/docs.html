<h1> Evaluation Metrics </h1>
<p> <b>Functionality:</b> This web service compares two xAIF files and reports various metrics for assessing their similarity. It is primarily intended for assessing the results of argument mining systems relative to gold standard data, or for calculating inter-annotator agreement between manually annotated files. </p>
<p> <b>Expected Input:</b> Two JSON xAIF files (with nodes and edges) containing identical text fields.</p>
<p> <b>Expected Output:</b> CASS, Macro F1, Accuracy, Text Similarity, Kappa, U-Alpha </p>
<br>
<p> <b>Sample command:</b> curl -X POST -F "file1=@file1.json" -F "file2=@file2.json" http://amf-evaluation-metrics.amfws.arg.tech</p>
<p> Both files must have identical text fields.</p>
